# ConfigPortal32Adv

### Credits

The **ConfigPortal32Adv** library is based on https://github.com/yhur/ConfigPortal32 by Yoonseok Hur.

The original library was incorporated into this project on August 15, 2025.

### Changes

**18.08.2025**

1. Added styles for input field labels and placeholders
2. Introduced InputField and InputGroup structs to divide parameters into WiFi and Other categories
3. Enabled pre-loading of existing settings into the configuration page
4. Removed user\_config\_html. Use the InputField instead to add new fields to the Web form.
5. The sketch uses nearly 1 MB of flash; consider increasing the firmware partition size on the ESP32

### Description

Like the original, **ConfigPortal32Adv** is fully contained within a single header file: ConfigPortal32Adv.h.

It provides a captive portal for Wi-Fi provisioning and runtime configuration via a browser-based interface. Supported input types include:

* text
* checkbox
* password
* email
* number
* date
* time
* color

Configuration data is stored in a file within the **LittleFS** filesystem, located in the ESP32's flash memory. This configuration persists across device reboots.

A common use case is initial setup of the Wi-Fi SSID and password.

The portal displays the current configuration in a simple web form. Users can modify parameters and submit the form via the **Save** button. The library then writes the updated parameters to the config file in flash.

**Note**: The library does not validate parameter types, values, or constraints. Validation is left to the developer.

##### Example of usage

The accompanying .ino file demonstrates how to use the library. In its current form, the portal is always displayed â€” meaning the firmware never proceeds beyond the configuration stage.



This behavior is intentional for demonstration purposes. In a real application, you should modify the logic to conditionally display the portal only when configuration is required.

---

##### Example of real application usage

The files ConfigPortalUtils.h and ConfigPortalUtils.h describe one possible expansion of the CaptivePortal32Adv described earlier.

The logic to conditionaly display the portal only when configuration is required is implemented on the first configuration, and on demand via BOOT_PIN on the ESP32D board

After configuration is done, ConfigPortalUtils exposes two ways of connecting to the WiFi network:
  1. by calling directly wifiConnect function
  2. by calling conenctToKnownNetworks function

The function for connectiong to known networks implements the logic of remmembering the last connected network, and a list of all the previously connected network as pairs of ssid and password.

ConfigPortalUtils also provides integration and interation with OLED display if it is connected.

Other utils, like responding to serial commands are also present and easily extendable.

### Further Work

Potential improvements include:

* Migrating to an async web server to free the main loop from frequent polling
* Adding support for parameter arrays
* Modularisation to smaller purpose code segmentation, and namespace appliance for reusability and scalability purposes.
